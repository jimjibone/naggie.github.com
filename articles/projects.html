		<h1>DSPA</h1>
		<p>
			DSPA is an automated network based public announcement system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clients exist for google chrome and nodejs. Messages
			are automatically synthesised via the festival TTS
			engine and then played with lag compensation on any
			number of nodes at exactly the same time!
		</p>
		<p>
			A location tree is used to allow messages to be sent to
			specific zones. This means a message can be sent to a
			specific room, house, or even city!
		</p>
		<p>
			The google chrome extension is automatically built and
			deployed as an update to all existing clients.

		<p>It is capable of monitoring statistics from anything capable

		<p>It summarises the information on a real-time dashboard

		<p>Here is it monitoring a network of servers.</p>

		<p>Depending on what I wish to do with it, it will be released

		<h1>Modular power flow controller</h1>
		<p> As my third year project for my MEng course at the
		university of Leicester, I developed a battery management
		system capable of monitoring and maintaining the health of a
		large Li-Ion based battery stack.  </p> <p> The system uses an
		optically isolated SPI bus to read the temperature and voltage
		of each battery module.  The system is able to isolate any
		battery at any time, automatically, should the health of a cell
		depend on it.  </p> <p> The system could be used in
		circumstances where high availability and reliability is of
		foremost concern; for example, as part of a micro-grid (for
		renewable energy storage) where energy is required and
		available unpredictably.  </p> <p> The project report will be
		here soon, after it is assessed.  For the mean time, <a
		href="pres/MPFC/">here is a presentation.</a> </p>
