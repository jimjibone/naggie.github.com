uses <a href="http://socket.io">http://socket.io</a>.</p>

<p>It is capable of monitoring statistics from anything capable of producing
discrete attributes. It has been successfully demonstrated with 2 use cases so
far: Monitoring a server farm and the state of 36 battery cells in real time 
on a power flow controller</p>

<p>It summarises the information on a real-time dashboard available in a web
interface.</p>

<p>Here is it monitoring a network of servers.</p>

<p>Depending on what I wish to do with it, it will be released but licensing is
still to be considered.</p>
