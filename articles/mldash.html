<p>MLdash is a general real-time montioring system. It runs on top of nodejs and
uses <a href="http://socket.io">http://socket.io</a>.</p>

<p>It is capable of monitoring statistics from anything capable of producing
discrete attributes. It has been successfully demonstrated with 2 use cases so
far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Monitoring a server farm in real time</li>
<li>Monitoring the state of 36 battery cells in real time on a power flow controller</li>
</ol>

<p>It summarises the information on a real-time dashboard available in a web
interface.</p>

<p>Here is it monitoring a network of servers.</p>

<p>Depending on what I wish to do with it, it will be released but licensing is
still to be considered.</p>
