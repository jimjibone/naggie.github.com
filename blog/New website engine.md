Hopefully youâ€™re reading this blog from <http://callanbryant.co.uk/> rather than wordpress.

My new website engine is now able to read RSS feeds thanks to the incredibly easy-to-use jFeed. This was after writing my own (jQuery based) parser which worked, but supporting the inconsistencies of RSS or ATOM was not worth the bother.

The engine automatically integrates articles, linking to them on the nav bar above; supporting embedded or external source in HTML, markdown or RSS.

Preloading is handled, too. The jQuery based article engine will be open-sourced when I have time to package it as a proper jQuery module.
