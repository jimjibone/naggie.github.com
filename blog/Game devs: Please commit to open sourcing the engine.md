I realised something the other day.

**I don’t necessarily use open source games because they are free; but because they have a guaranteed future.**

The problem with purely commercial PC games is not the price; it’s that they ‘decay.’ Look at the problems associated with [Diablo II][1] or [System shock 2][2] for example. They both require lots of unofficial patches and hacks to allow them to play at all on windows 7.

I am very happy to pay for a copy of a game, knowing that I can use it in 10 years time with an open-sourced engine.

Look at the success of what ID software have done. [They have open-sourced][4] the Doom 1,2 Quake 1,2,3 and Doom 3 engines (known as IDtech1 IDtech2 IDtech3 and IDtech4). As a result, Quake III works great even now, and **Doom 3 will also still work in 10 years time.**

It’s not necessary to open the source right away either. **Just a commitment will suffice**; Minecraft, for example, will [eventually become open-source][5].

Make a profit, then release the engine as open source to continue legacy and sales!

Maybe there could be an emblem or something to indicate the commitment.
