This website now features a markdown powered blog!

Rather than outsourcing the blogging to wordpress, which was very troubling,
I have created a new blog engine.

The blog articles are written in markdown and a manifest of each is mantained.
Articles are dynamically loaded when you scroll, hopefully with a seamless effect!

The idea was inspired by <http://martinmoen.com/>. Thanks Martin!

It is still in an early stage and [lots is planned!][1]
