Move away from markdown system towards the 960.gs
Still loading everything at once somehow.

jsdom to just replace divs with the contents of something.html

eg: <div id="whatever" class="embed" data-src="mldash.html"></div>

with node compiler, serverside,  possibly clientside.


Switch to git

throbber in place of loading HTML

nav generated from divs?
