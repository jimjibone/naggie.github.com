MLdash is a general real-time montioring system. It runs on top of nodejs and
uses <http://socket.io>.

It is capable of monitoring statistics from anything capable of producing
discrete attributes. It has been successfully demonstrated with 2 use cases so
far:

  1. Monitoring a server farm in real time
  2. Monitoring the state of 36 battery cells in real time on a power flow controller

It summarises the information on a real-time dashboard available in a web
interface.

Here is it monitoring a network of servers.

Depending on what I wish to do with it, it will be released but licensing is
still to be considered.
